# LEVEL
Solves the Schroedinger equation for a diatomic molecule to get the vibrational and rotational energies and expectation values. A project that Bob LeRoy worked on since the 1960s with contributions from Nike Dattani starting in 2007.

The motivation for putting this on GitHub today was [this question](https://mattermodeling.stackexchange.com/q/6175/5) on the Matter Modeling Stack Exchange, which will require defining the M operator for certain hyperfine structure constants, which will be a further contribution to the present most up-to-date version of LEVEL. The most recent version I could find online is the 2016 version from JQSRT, but this versionw which I'm uploading today seems to have last been modified on Aug 23 2018 (screenshot saved on my computer today).
