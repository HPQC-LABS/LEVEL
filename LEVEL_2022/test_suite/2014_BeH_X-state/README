(1) level_withTrialEnergies.9 seems to be identical to Table IV of Dattani's 2015 BeH paper for the 2014 Empirical column, when you look at the p6q33N6_IROUND-1 case. 
(2) but (1) doesn't have 13 levels for BeH of 2011 Koput.
(3) level.9 has 13 levels for BeH, but not 20 levels for BeT (for 2011 Koput), and not the correct (p6q3N6_IROUND-1) case for 2014 Empirical
(4) level_withTrialEnergies_BOB.9 has 20 levels for BeT (though one is weirdly labelled as 21?!) for (2011 Koput), but doesn't have BeH.
